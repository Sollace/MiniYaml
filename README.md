# Mini Yaml

Provides a minimalistic, from-scratch YAML-JSON converter.

When I needed a yaml parser for parsing config files for Minecraft mods, I realised the ones that existed are
all really _big_, and had a lot of features I'm not going to use. I also needed something that can directly serialize
to/from GSON json element trees, so this is what that is.
